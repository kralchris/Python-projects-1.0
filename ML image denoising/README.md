  <h1>ML - Image Denoising</h1>

  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>This project addresses the problem of noise reduction in digital images using Python. The code provided demonstrates the application of a specific denoising technique to a noisy image.</p>
  
  <h2>Method</h2>
  <p>The median filter is a common and effective technique used for removing noise from images. It works by replacing each pixel value with the median value of its neighboring pixels. This approach is effective in reducing random noise while preserving edges and details in the image. The resulting denoised_image is then displayed using matplotlib.pyplot.imshow, with a grayscale colormap and the title "Denoised Image".</p>
  <p>The denoised_image variable is generated by applying the ndimage.median_filter function from the SciPy library to the original image. The size parameter specifies the filter size, which is set to 3 in this case.</p>

  <h2>Code</h2>
  <p>The code utilizes the following libraries:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>numpy</code> - for numerical operations on arrays</li>
    <li><code>matplotlib.pyplot</code> - for plotting and visualizing images</li>
    <li><code>scipy.ndimage</code> - for image processing operations</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The code performs the following steps:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Import the necessary libraries.</li>
    <li>Load the noisy image.</li>
    <li>Display the noisy image.</li>
    <li>Apply image denoising using a median filter.</li>
    <li>Display the denoised image.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Please make sure to provide the path to the actual noisy and denoised image files in the code, replacing "path/to/noisy_image.jpg" and "path/to/denoised_image.jpg". Also, ensure that the necessary libraries (numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, and scipy) are installed before running the code.</p>

  <p>Feel free to modify the code according to your specific requirements or integrate it into your own project.</p>
